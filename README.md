`/upload` - JSON formatted config for where it is to fetch source files for upload to google storage

`/datasets/<bucket name>/entities` - returns JSON formatted entities listing all files at the google storage from bucket with <bucket name>
Available query parameters (all optional)  
* expire: date time in format %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S - overrides default expire time
* with_subfolders: False by default if assigned will include blobs from subfolders
* with_prefix: to filter blobs by prefix
```
[
    {
        "file_id": "some-file-name",
        "content_type": your_content_type",
        "file_url": "url/to/file/" <- signed URL with expiration date
    },
    ...
]
```

`/download/<bucket name>/<file path>` - downloads file from Google Storage Bucket  
file path may include slashes to download file from bucket sub-folder

`/upload/<bucket_name>` - uploads file to bucket

`/sink/<bucket_name>` - Sesam json push sink for sending json entities to a Google Storage Bucket and save them as files.
